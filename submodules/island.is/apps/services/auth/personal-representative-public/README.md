# Personal Representative Public

## About

A service that is responsible for giving third party service providers information about personal representatives and their rights

## Context

The purpose of the Public API for the Personal Representative Database is to allow Service providers ,that are unable or unwilling to use Digital Iceland’s login service, to get information about personal representatives and their clients to give the personal representative access to services on behalf of the client according to the rights given in the contract and connection.

The API allows service providers to get information about possible rights as well as the connections a single personal representative has to clients.

The service providers are required to use secure logins and only query by logged in users.

### Example of connections
