# BFF (Backend for Frontend)

## About

The BFF (Backend for Frontend) service serves as an intermediary layer for multiple clients, such as the admin portal, service portal, and other applications. It is designed to centralize authentication and business logic, ensuring a secure and streamlined communication process between clients and backend resources.

This service handles user authentication through our IdentityServer, facilitating secure access and session management. Once authenticated, the BFF proxies and manages requests to our GraphQL API, ensuring only authorized requests are processed.
