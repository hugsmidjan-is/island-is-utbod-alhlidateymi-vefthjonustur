# Financial Statemens for the Icelandic National Audit Office (INAO)

Endpoint to return financial statements for cemeteries, political parties, and individuals in personal elections to the Icelandic National Audit Office (Ríkisendurskoðun). These are organisations/individuals who are exempt from submitting financial statements to the Icelandic Revenue and Customs (Skatturinn).

The purpose of this endpoint is to be a gateway between an application-template that is used to return those financial statements and an Office365 application that is hosted in the cloud.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test api-domains-financial-statements-inao` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
