# Utils

This folder is for all the utility functions, constants, enums and types.

The organization of this folder is up to the developer. Try to aim for a happy medium between small focused files and too many files that bloat the folder. The aim is that a developer can enter this folder and understand what the utils are for and have a nice overview of the utils.
