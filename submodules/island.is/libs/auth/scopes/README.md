# Auth Scopes

This library was generated to contain scope definitions in one central place for the repo.

## Creating scopes in the IDS

It is possible to create the actual scopes in production using Sequelize migrations. Please follow [the guide in auth-api-lib](../../auth-api-lib/seeders/README.md).
