# judicial-system-court-client

This library was is for integrating with the Icelandic Court System Au√∞ur.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test judicial-system-court-client` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Client generated by running

`./node_modules/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/bin/openapi-generator generate -g typescript-fetch --additional-properties=typescriptThreePlus=true -o libs/judicial-system/court-client/gen/fetch -i libs/judicial-system/court-client/src/clientConfig.json`

## Updating

Start by getting a new OpenApi JSON description and past it into `./src/clientConfig.json`. Then generate the client and procede to up update `./src/lib/courtClient.service.ts`. Note that in the current implementation `UploadStream` has been removed from `./src/clientConfig.json` and implemented from scratch.
