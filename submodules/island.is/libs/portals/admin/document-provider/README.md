# Document Provider

## About

This module is a management portal for Document Providers, where they can:

- See statistics for their documents.
- Manage document's categories and types.
- Manage settings, such as set the endpoint to their API where documents are provided.

### Document Providers

Document Providers are those who can send document references to the mailbox on island.is and provide the document on their servers when asked for. Documents are never stored on island.is' servers.

## Work in progress

Eventually this module should live under institutions service portal. Since the development of the institutions service portal hasn't stared yet, we have put it under the navigation bar in "Mínar síður" and only few people will have access to it. The access will done with hard-coded nationalID's in the meantime.
