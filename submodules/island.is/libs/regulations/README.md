# Regulations

Types, components and helper utilities for working with Regulations (Regluger√∞ir) across different parts of the monorepo.

Some of the utilities contained herein may be more generally applicable, for sure, but they're currently exclusively used by Regulations-related parts of the monorepo.

Those bits may later move into other libs. Den tid, den refactoring.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test regulations` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
